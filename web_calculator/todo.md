1. convert calculate() to using decimal precise library.
3. Chain multiple calculations together.
4. History of calculations.
    - Display the history in a window.
5. Fix background grid imaging.
6. Add a 'Clear' button to delete all inputs.
8. Add styling that makes it obvious that input is happening.
9. Clear all button.



Bugs:

- [design] - what about only pushing numbers to state when ready to calculate??

- [bug] - when half way through deleting a number, and try to add a number, it will sustain that added number after you delete the former number, and all other numbers.

- [bug] - Number -> equals === weird display shit, maybe only if number A and numberB have values do you allow it to calculate?
