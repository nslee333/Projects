1. convert calculate() to using decimal precise library.
9. clear all button.
10. [fix] - need to make the position of the buttons absolute.
11. Re-add footer element after completion.



Bugs:

- [design] - what about only pushing numbers to state when ready to calculate??

- [bug] - when half way through deleting a number, and try to add a number, it will sustain that added number after you delete the former number, and all other numbers.

- [bug] - Number -> equals === weird display shit, maybe only if number A and numberB have values do you allow it to calculate? 


[current] [task]
- finishing last styling things.
