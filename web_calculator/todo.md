1. convert calculate() to using decimal precise library.
4. History of calculations.

5. Fix background grid imaging.
8. Add styling that makes it obvious that input is happening.
9. clear all button.
10. [fix] - need to make the position of the buttons absolute.



Bugs:

- [design] - what about only pushing numbers to state when ready to calculate??

- [bug] - when half way through deleting a number, and try to add a number, it will sustain that added number after you delete the former number, and all other numbers.

- [bug] - Number -> equals === weird display shit, maybe only if number A and numberB have values do you allow it to calculate? 


[current] [task]
