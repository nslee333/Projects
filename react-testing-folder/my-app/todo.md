React testing todo:


1. Add decimal precise library calculations to calculation() function?
    - Decide on this :)
2. Clear all button
    - Clear history too?
    - Commands?

3. History of calculations.

Current task: - history of calculations

Everytime a calculation is made
    - calculation is converted into a string.
    - The string is then pushed to a history array, then we display it to the user.

Need to submit an entry if 

&& historyArray[historyArray.length - 1] !== entry
