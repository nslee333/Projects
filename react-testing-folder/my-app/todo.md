React testing todo:


2. Add decimal precise library calculations to calculation() function.


Del key ->
It's not deleting since useEffect is calling stateCheck().
Need to figure out a way to keep checking the state, but also allow for deletion.

Everytime I try to delete the result
- it resets it because of useEffect checkState call which I can't really get rid of.

When I turn off checkState in useEffect I can't calculate more.

Stopped with trying to figure out a way to bypass delete key problem.
